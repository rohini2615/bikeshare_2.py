Udacity Bike share project

This is the second project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program where bike rideshare data for a few select cities such as
(New York, Chicago, and Washington, DC) are used to create a terminal application that gives a set of summary statistics for each city. 
This is implemented in Python. Also Use Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data. Calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a 
dataset to analyze.
